- ssh X forwarding from docker in shell script (visual studio!)
- path of the projects (.opt) is quite diabolical
- the install script is also the script to basically do everything
- nrpStorage (is that the place to keep experiments)
- container path not clear with the "\"
- documentation https://developer.humanbrainproject.eu/docs/projects/hbp-nrp-cle/1.1.8/
- It would be good to have the 'save to storage' button in the Object Inspector as well as the Object Library.
- Undo button in the object Inspector would be very useful.
- When running an experiment for the first time after starting the server, there is normally a Gazebo error. On a second attempt it runs without error.
- unable to use names with leading underscore. eg. __init__, _variablename etc
- ability to scale non primitive shapes would be useful. Currently I have been using the developer tools to remove the disabled property on the input box has worked as expected with some objects.
- Having the option to duplicate on any object would be useful.
